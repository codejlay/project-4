Project 4 - Mars Colony Hybrid App

Description and Requirements:
For Project 4, you’re going to create a web-based app for Earth colonists exploring Mars using AngularJS.

Your project must:
Meet the design (look & feel) and interaction specifications as closely as possible.
Have a Git repository initialized in its root directory
Be pushed to GitHub (with all of your commits synced to it)
Use Gulp for running build tasks, such as minification and error checking

Your project must:
Contain pages and routes for all of the views in the specification.
Implement HTML push-state navigation.
Implement the ui-router plugin.
Define a route for each view in the specification.
Restrict access to the ‘Registration’ route when the user has already registered.
Implement the following Angular directives:

ng-repeat
ng-click
ng-class
ng-show
ng-hide
ng-if

Implement the following AngluarJS Modules:
Service
Factory
Controller
Directive

Your project must:
Use a CSS reset
Implement a mobile-first responsive layout using Flexbox (Mobile only)

Your project must:
Implement at least one unit-test or e2e test
Implement basic ajax GET and POST requests using Angular’s $http service to:
Save a new colonists information
Save a new alien encounter
Fetch a list of recent encounters
Remove a colonist from the colony
Determine if a colonist has already registered
Create a new ailen type
Create a new encounter

Stretch goals:
Use Angular’s ng-touch directive to implement swipe-left and swipe-right navigation.
Use Angular’s ng-animate module to implement animated page transitions.

Experience gained:
This project mainly focused on AngularJS which was a great learning experience. Less code to make things work, who doesn’t like that? Getting all the proper steps was initially challenging as with learning something new. Learning to use CSS animation was also very cool. The project also helped me practice once again using API’s.  Although AngularJS was challenging at first to learn, it was a great experience as this project felt more like an app than a website!
