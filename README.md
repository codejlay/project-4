View deployed site through [GitHub Pages.](http://codejlay.github.io/project04-mars-colony)

**Summary:**

A web-based app for Earth colonists exploring Mars using AngularJS.

1. Implement basic ajax GET and POST requests using Angular’s $http service to:
  - Save a new colonists information
  - Save a new alien encounter
  - Fetch a list of recent encounters
  - Determine if a colonist has already registered
  - Create a new encounter
2. Use Angular modules to easily implement swipe-left and swipe-right navigation as well as animated page transitions. 


**Tools and methods used to build site:**

- ngAnimate, ngCookies, ngTouch
- Flexbox
- Gulp, SASS, Autoprefixer, Browser-Sync


**Experience from the project:**

This project mainly focused on AngularJS which was a great learning experience. Less code to make things work, who doesn’t like that? Getting all the proper steps was initially challenging as with learning something new. Learning to use CSS animation was also very cool. The project also helped me practice once again using API’s.  Although AngularJS was challenging at first to learn, it was a great experience as this project felt more like an app than a website!
